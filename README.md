Mercury here, guy from China who loves Rock 'N Roll, I know nothing about 
the the computer or the internet, I compose programs I can imagine.

Hello, it's me.

All of the projects I have built are terming to be free softwares, if 
you need the source code, just take, here what I say is the license.

Currently I'm working on [substrate][substrate] things and maybe some 
WASM things. I'm curious about the distributed *, WASM, rust is the best 
programming language, and emacs is the best editor.

That is, happiness only real when shared.

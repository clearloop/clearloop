Mercury here, guy from China who loves Rock 'N Roll, I know nothing about 
the the computer or the internet, but I compose programs I can imagine.

Hello, it's me.

The final and the greatest project of mine in this world of the internet 
is creating amazing frameworks for building APPs, [cdr.today][cdr.today] 
for backend and [elvis][elvis] for the frontend, the aspiration of these
two projects is anybody can construct their own APPs based on them even 
they haven't learn programming at school, it's fine.

All of the projects I have built are terming to be free softwares, if you
need the source code, just take, here what I say is the license.

Currently I'm working at [@patractlabs][patractlabs] for making a life and 
integrating into the society, doing [substrate][substrate] things and maybe
some WASM things.

I'm curious about the distributed *, wasm, rust is the besting programming
language, and emacs is the best editor.

That is.

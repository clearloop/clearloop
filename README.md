Mercury here, guy from China who loves Rock 'N Roll, I know nothing about 
the the computer or the internet, I compose programs I can imagine.

Hello, it's me.

The final and the greatest project of mine in this world of the internet
is creating amazing frameworks for building APPs, [cdr.today][cdr.today]
for the backend and [elvis][elvis] for the frontend, the aspiration of
these two projects is anybody can construct their own APPs based on them
even they haven't learned programming at school, it's fine.

All of the projects I have built are terming to be free softwares, if you
need the source code, just take, here what I say is the license.

Currently I'm working on [substrate][substrate] things and maybe some WASM 
things at [@patractlabs][patractlabs]. I'm curious about the distributed *,
WASM, rust is the best programming language, and emacs is the best editor.

That is, happiness only real when shared.
